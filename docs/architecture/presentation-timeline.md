# Presentation timeline

The game resolves its events instantly: a whole CPU turn, with every move and cast, is played within a single frame. The battle scene replays those events in order, at a pace the player can follow, through the [`BattleSceneTimeline`](../../src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mkz/rpg/screen/adapters/presentation/BattleSceneTimeline.kt).

## How it works

- `BattleScene` creates a single timeline and passes it to every presenter.
- Presenters never draw an event straight away. They add a **step** to the timeline with `play { ... }`.
- The timeline plays its steps one after another, in the order they are added. A step may take time, e.g.: a battle unit walking tile by tile. The following steps wait for it to finish.
- When the timeline is idle, a new step starts straight away, so instant steps (e.g.: hiding the HUD) are displayed as soon as their event arrives.

For example, when the CPU moves two rats and the turn passes back to the human player:

| Event arrives (same frame)         | Step played                                         |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `BattleUnitMoved` (first rat)      | The first rat walks its path                        |
| `BattleUnitMoved` (second rat)     | Then, the second rat walks its path                 |
| `PlayerTurnStarted` (human player) | Then, the battle info displays the human player turn |

## Rules

- Presenters MUST read what a step needs when its event arrives, and only draw it inside the step. By the time the step is played, the battle may have moved on, e.g.: a battle unit that walks is defeated later in the same CPU turn, so it can no longer be found.
- Every visual change caused by a battle event MUST go through the timeline, so the scene never displays a later state before an earlier one.
- The player MUST NOT act while the timeline is playing (`isPlaying`): selecting tiles or abilities, cancelling or confirming a cast and finishing the turn are ignored. The scene still displays a past state of the battle meanwhile.

## Moving battle units

`BattleUnitMoved` carries the `path` walked: the tiles from the origin (excluded) to the destination (included). Each tile costs one step. The path is the shortest one found by [`SearchShortestPath`](../../src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mkz/rpg/battlefield/usecases/queries/SearchShortestPath.kt) through tiles that can be occupied. A teleport jumps straight to its destination, so its path only has the destination.

`BattlefieldView.moveBattleUnit` displays the battle unit on each tile of the path, stopping `MOVE_STEP_DURATION` (150ms) on each one. Before each step, it scrolls the battlefield to center the tile when the tile is out of the viewport or on its edge. A battlefield smaller than the viewport is never scrolled.
